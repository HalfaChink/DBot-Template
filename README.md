# Python Discord Bot Template


This repository is a template that everyone can use for the start of their discord bot.

When I first started creating my discord bot it took me a while to get everything setup and working with cogs and more.
I would've been happy if there were any template existing. However, there wasn't any existing template. That's why I
decided to create my own template to let <b>you</b> guys create your discord bot easily.

Please note that this template is not supposed to be the best template, but a good template to start learning how
discord.py works and to make your own bot easily.

If you plan to use this template to make your own template or bot, you **have to**:

- Keep the credits, and a link to this repository in all the files that contains my code
- Keep the same license for unchanged code

See [the license file](https://github.com/kkrypt0nn/Python-Discord-Bot-Template/blob/master/LICENSE.md) for more
information, I reserve the right to take down any repository that does not meet these requirements.

## Support

Before requesting support, you should know that this template requires you to have at least a **basic knowledge** of
Python and the library is made for advanced users. Do not use this template if you don't know the
basics. [Here's](https://pythondiscord.com/pages/resources) a link for resources to learn python.

If you need some help for something, do not hesitate to contact me on discord **Halfa#6592**.

## Disclaimer

Slash commands can take some time to get registered globally, so if you want to test a command you should use
the `@app_commands.guilds()` decorator so that it gets registered instantly. Example:

```py
@commands.hybrid_command(
  name="command",
  description="Command description",
)
@app_commands.guilds(GUILD_ID) # Place your guild ID here
```

When using the template you confirm that you have read the [license](LICENSE.md) and comprehend that I can take down
your repository if you do not meet these requirements.

Please do not open issues or pull requests about things that are written in the [TODO file](TODO.md), they are **already** under work for a future version of the template.

## How to set up

To set up the bot I made it as simple as possible. I now created a [config.json](config.json) file where you can put the
needed things to edit.

Here is an explanation of what everything is:

| Variable                  | What it is                                                            |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| YOUR_BOT_PREFIX_HERE      | The prefix you want to use for normal commands                        |
| YOUR_BOT_TOKEN_HERE       | The token of your bot                                                 |
| YOUR_BOT_PERMISSIONS_HERE | The permissions integer your bot needs when it gets invited           |
| YOUR_APPLICATION_ID_HERE  | The application ID of your bot                                        |
| OWNERS                    | The user ID of all the bot owners                                     |


## How to start

To start the bot you simply need to launch, either your terminal (Linux, Mac & Windows), or your Command Prompt (
Windows)
.

Before running the bot you will need to install all the requirements with this command:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you have multiple versions of python installed (2.x and 3.x) then you will need to use the following command:

```
python3 bot.py
```

or eventually

```
python3.x bot.py
```
Replace `x` with the version of Python you have installed.

If you have just installed python today, then you just need to use the following command:

```
python bot.py
```
